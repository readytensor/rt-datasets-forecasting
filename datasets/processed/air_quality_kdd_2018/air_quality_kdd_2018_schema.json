  "description": "Air Quality KDD 2018 is a time series dataset from the KDD Cup 2018 competition, featuring 270 hourly series of air quality data from 59 stations in Beijing and London (01/01/2017 to 31/03/2018). It includes various air quality measurements and handles missing values through zero replacement and carrying forward last observations (LOCF). Useful for benchmarking time series forecasting algorithms in air quality prediction. Original dataset contained air quality data for stations from Beijing and London. In this curated dataset, only the air quality data for stations from Beijing is included.",
