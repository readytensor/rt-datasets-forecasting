  "title": "Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations",
  "description": "The Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations dataset comprises measurements of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, expressed in parts per million (ppm). The data spans from March 1958 onwards, providing a long-term record of one of the greenhouse gases affecting Earth's climate. The dataset's monthly resolution allows for observing seasonal variations and long-term trends in CO2 concentrations. Sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory, this dataset is a valuable resource in climate change research and environmental studies.",
