  "title": "Correlated Sine Waves",
  "description": "The Correlated Sine Waves Dataset is a synthetic dataset designed to simulate multiple time series forecasting scenarios with underlying trends, patterns, noise, anomalies, and changepoints. It generates derived sine wave time series with variations in trend, amplitude, noise, point anomalies, and changepoints based on a base sine wave series. These variations create correlated time series with shared patterns but individual characteristics. This dataset is valuable for testing time series forecasting models, anomaly detection algorithms, and changepoint detection techniques, providing a versatile testbed for time series analysis methodologies that replicate real-world challenges.",
