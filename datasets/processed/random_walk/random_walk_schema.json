  "title": "Random Walk Dataset",
  "description": "This synthetically generated random walk dataset is a collection of 70 individual time series, each involving 500 time steps. This dataset is generated using the random walk process, a statistical phenomenon often encountered in fields as varied as physics and finance, where each point in the series is a sum of its predecessor and a random fluctuation. Each random fluctuation at every step is drawn independently from a normal distribution, and this process is independent of the current state or any past steps. This dataset is a valuable resource to explore the principles and applications of random walks processes for timeseries analysis.",
